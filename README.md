# 🎵 Grammys Web Analytics and Demographics Analysis

## Overview

This project explores web engagement trends and demographic patterns surrounding the Grammy Awards. By analyzing live web analytics and age-based demographic data from Grammy-related platforms, we aim to uncover insights into audience behavior before, during, and after the award show.

The analysis was conducted in a Jupyter Notebook and incorporates:

- Web traffic analysis across different Grammy events  
- Demographic breakdowns (age-wise)  
- Comparative insights with a secondary reference event (RA)  
- Key metrics like pageviews, session durations, bounce rates, and peak activity times  

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Grammys_Student.ipynb`: Main notebook containing the full analysis, visualizations, and interpretations.  
- `grammy_live_web_analytics.csv`: Web analytics data for Grammy event pages, including traffic and engagement metrics.  
- `grammys_age_demographics.csv`: Age-wise demographic breakdown of Grammy event site visitors.  
- `ra_live_web_analytics.csv`: Comparable web analytics data for a secondary reference event (RA).  
- `desktop_users.csv`: Additional dataset possibly used for cross-referencing device usage or behavior patterns (optional).  

## 🧪 Key Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- CSV data processing  

## 📊 Key Insights

- Traffic spikes correlate strongly with award night and awards week.  
- Younger age groups (18–34) dominate engagement metrics, especially on mobile.  
- Average session duration and bounce rates offer clues about audience intent and attention span.  
- Comparative analysis with RA event reveals how audience behavior differs across events.
